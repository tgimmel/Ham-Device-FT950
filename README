Ham-Device-FT950 version 0.29
=============================

Ham::Device::FT950 is a Perl package to control Yaesu FT-950 Amateur Radio
Transceiver.  This is not a full implementation of all the CAT functions available, but most
of the most important functions are working.  It is based on Device::SerialPort to communicate
via RS-232 to the rig.  I have been using it with a USB adaptor successfully during
all of my testing and seems to work.  However it is not tested on very many different
platforms and I doubt is will work in Windows at all.

Ensure Device::SerialPort is installed on your system as well as the usual Perl install.  This
has been build on Debian Etch using Perl 5.8.8.  I do not see any reason it will not work using 
Perl 5.10.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
